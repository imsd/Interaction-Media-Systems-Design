After playing the game “The Founder” by Francis Tseng, I feel like this game is pretty interesting because it will give you the perspective of a “founder”. First, you can recruit more employee and help the company grow faster by producing products. Then, upgrading the office is a must because it boosts up the productivity and satisfaction. Lastly, one part I hate the most is that when the product starts to progress into the market, there will be more competition that drags down the share. It was hard to compete with “Yphone” to the real Apple “iPhone”. However, I still like the game and would recommend to my friends.
