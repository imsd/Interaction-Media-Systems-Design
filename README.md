#Proposal

What the thoughts behind this?

First of all, we tend to keep this project as simple as it can get. 
Since we have the knownledge from the previous class(using siphon and unity),
Our first attempt was to make a 360 cube box with 4 camera inside, every screen has its own audio.
Then, some crazy idea came up. It was a tic tac toe game...
Basically, we create 9 cubes with each camera attached on the top view. 
Next, attached a input scrit, when the user press a key, the cube will turn blue/red.
Lastly, we used this concept && iterate && negotiate && over && over till "Tic Tac Toe in 3D".
Finally, we use the boxes and formated in 3D shape and use the projection software and map on to it.

# Unity project 2 ---- 3D Tic Tac Toe

			


#Documentation

*How we thought about the game wasn’t only simple and easy our group wanted a 2 player game that would have a nice cubic design for all of 9 boxes which make up tic tac toe and it could look colorful for first player and the second player.

*The materials used to make the tic tac toe game		
- Unity
- Scripts (ex. Funnel, input, sound, and etc)
- Syphon
- Projection
- Audio
- Boxes

Description of the project 						
Our description for project is attempting to develop a unity game of tic tac toe instead of a simplest version to making it 3d unity based we as the game will provide a funny and colorful experience.

* The struggles the team had during our process for the project.
 As we were developing a tic tac toe project our team has encounter some issues for 3d tick tic toe game for instance the button keys when we already placed 9 cubes with keys what we thought it was, but turns out they’re completely randomized which makes it harder to tell the keys to press for both players. Another problem the team has is mapping because during the progression to making the game we had to design boxes that would fit exact location where the projector will point at we have tried many different ideas to how to do it so it wasn’t easy since the projector and mapping were keys to make the project difficult. Lastly the problem of the group project was scripts our team had to find in order to make this happen because without the scripts such as funnel, syphon, input, audio, and background music in the unity nothing would function in the mapping.

* The final thoughts our group has to say about the project
- Our group has thought the project it is fun to make in the unity by adding funny hilarious sounds and developing for then just a plain tic tac toe game it would be 3d colorful based. Lastly if our group wanted to add a few more adjusts to the game it would be like 3d tic tac toe game that has dancing colorful based on all 9 boxes of the game also a victory sound at the end of the game.
